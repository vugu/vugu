<!-- This is the Hellobutton. It is just a button with a 'Click' method associated with the 'onclick' DOM event -->
<!-- At this point 'c' is now a HelloButton component and NOT a Parent component, so the '@click' -->
<!-- refers to the button and not the parents component -->
<button @click='c.Click(event)'>Click me...</button>
