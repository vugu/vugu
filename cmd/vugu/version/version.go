// Print the vugu version information to STDOUT. This is the implementation of the `vugu version` sub command.
// The version number written to STDOUT has one of two forms.
//
// If the `vuguâ€œ command was built
// via the mage build script then the format is the same as the output of a [git describe] comamnd,
// when passed the "--dirty" option and prefixed with "vugu version". For example:
//
// vugu version v0.4.0-139-g3fe0108-dirty
//
// Where the format is <last-tag>-<number-of-commits-beyond-tag>-<short-hash-of-last-commit>[-dirty]
//
// So in the above case the tag is "v0.4.0", the last commit is 130 commits after that tag, and
// the last commit was "g3fe0108". The "-dirty" indicates that the repo has chnages yet
// to be commited.
//
// If the `vugu` command was build directly via a "go install" or a "go build" outside of the
// magefile then the version format only prints the hash of the last commit
// and the optional "-dirty" if the repo had uncommited changes. For example:
//
// vugu version 3fe01084fba260c70b6cf7862100471fbb01e834-dirty
//
// Where fe01084fba260c70b6cf7862100471fbb01e834 is the hash of the last commit.
